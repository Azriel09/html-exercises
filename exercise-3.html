      <strong>MANILA, Philippines</strong> - The measure seeking the regulation
      of vaporized nicotine (vape) and non-nicotine products <br />
      as well as novel tobacco products - also known as the
      <u><strong>"Vape Bill"</strong></u> - has lapsed into law. <br />
      The measure regulates the importation, manufacture, sale, packaging,
      distribution, use, <br />
      and communication of vaporized nicotine or vape and non-nicotine products,
      including novel tobacco products.

      Pandemic lessons - Compassion, Service
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>"No man is an island."</i> a well-known adage that people use to
      describe how we are all interconnected with one another. <br />
      But the pandemic lockdowns posed a challenge to everyone's sense of
      community. <br />Yet, the pandemic has also been the
      <u>best time to extend a helping hand to others</u> in the practice of
      <strong>compassion and service</strong> in the same way that
      <em>Saint Loyola</em> did. <br />It also taught us to be closer to God
      through prayers and gave us a new purpose in life. <br />
